### TASKS

- Grab a sphere, have it snap into a "seat" (upon release) if it's within X cm

- A sphere that changes from white to blue based on palm proximity, and red when within the near threshold

- A simplified cursor-on-plane scenario, with a box that changes color when the cursor is over it

- A sphere that pushes away from your palm, and has a springy return to its original position when the palm moves away

- Make a script that places all its child objects along an evenly-spaced circle

### Notes


Stage 1 working `A sphere that changes from white to blue based on palm proximity, and red when within the near threshold`

Created a colider that flys with momentum to the cursor then stops and follows 1 : 1 ratio when the cursor moves. 

This is for simulating the meta hands top point or palm colider.
